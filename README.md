# Code-Nation-game-project-Aug-2021-
My 1st ever attemt at  text based RPG in Python showing use of: Lists, functions, variables, global variables, loops, random.randint & time.sleep


In this project the aim was to work as part of a team & design a text based game, using only what we learnt in week 1 (no classes or OOP).

Me & my team quickly settled on a text based RPG & the 4 of us got to work brainstorming. 

I was innitally incharge of making the flow chart for the project & coding the combat system but took on slightly more as we were 1 person short of the other team
& then lost another member. 
This quickly snowballed into me writing all the none print statement code seen in this initial commit, 
this was in part due to the speed in which I worked Vs the rest of the team, 
as well as the team being compltely new to the Python language and myself having (at the time) Very basic Python knowledge.
